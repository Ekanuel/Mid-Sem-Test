    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the 
        presentation of a document written in HTML or XML 
        (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how 
        elements should be rendered on screen, 
        on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>

        <p>The Difference Between Inline, External and Internal CSS Styles
            There are three ways you can use to implement CSS into your HTML: internal, external, and inline styles. Lets break them down.

            Internal CSS
            Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add style tag in the head section of your HTML document.

            This CSS style is an effective method of styling a single page. However, using this style 
            for multiple pages is time-consuming as you need to put CSS rules on every page of your website.</p>
            <p>External CSS
                With external CSS, you’ll link your web pages to an external .css file, which can be created by any text editor in your device (e.g., Notepad++).
                
                This CSS type is a more efficient method, especially for styling a large website. By editing one .css file, you can change your entire site at once.</p>

            <p>Inline CSS
                Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. For this CSS style, you’ll only need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without using selectors.</p>
